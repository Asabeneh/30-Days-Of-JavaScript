# ðŸ“” Day 3

## Booleans

A boolean data type represents one of the two values:_true_ or _false_. Boolean value is either true or false. The use of these data types will be clear when you start the comparison operator. Any comparisons return a boolean value which is either true or false.

**Example: Boolean Values**

```js
let isLightOn = true
let isRaining = false
let isHungry = false
let isMarried = true
let truValue = 4 > 3    // true
let falseValue = 4 < 3  // false
```

We agreed that boolean values are either true or false.

### Truthy values

- All numbers(positive and negative) are truthy except zero
- All strings are truthy except an empty string ('')
- The boolean true

### Falsy values

- 0
- 0n
- null
- undefined
- NaN
- the boolean false
- '', "", ``, empty string

It's important to remember truthy and falsy values. In later section, we will use them with conditions to make decisions.

## Undefined

If we declare a variable and if we do not assign a value, the value will be undefined. In addition to this, if a function is not returning the value, it will be undefined.

```js
let firstName
console.log(firstName) //not defined, because it is not assigned to a value yet
```

## Null

```js
let empty = null
console.log(empty) // -> null , means no value
```

## Operators

### Assignment operators

An equal sign in JavaScript is an assignment operator. It is used to assign a value to a variable.

```js
let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
let country = 'Finland'
```

Assignment Operators

![Assignment operators](../images/assignment_operators.png)

### Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are mathematical operators.

- Addition(+): a + b
- Subtraction(-): a - b
- Multiplication(*): a * b
- Division(/): a / b
- Modulus(%): a % b
- Exponential(**): a ** b

```js
let numOne = 4
let numTwo = 3
let sum = numOne + numTwo
let diff = numOne - numTwo
let mult = numOne * numTwo
let div = numOne / numTwo
let remainder = numOne % numTwo
let powerOf = numOne ** numTwo

console.log(sum, diff, mult, div, remainder, powerOf) // 7,1,12,1.33,1, 64

```

```js
const PI = 3.14
let radius = 100          // length in meter

//Let us calculate area of a circle
const areaOfCircle = PI * radius * radius
console.log(areaOfCircle)  //  314 m


const gravity = 9.81      // in m/s2
let mass = 72             // in Kilogram

// Let us calculate weight of an object
const weight = mass * gravity
console.log(weight)        // 706.32 N(Newton)

const boilingPoint = 100  // temperature in oC, boiling point of water
const bodyTemp = 37       // body temperature in oC


// Concatenating strings with numbers using string interpolation
/*
 The boiling point of water is 100 oC.
 Human body temperature is 37 oC.
 The gravity of earth is 9.81 m/s2.
 */
console.log(
  `The boiling point of water is ${boilingPoint} oC.\nHuman body temperature is ${bodyTemp} oC.\nThe gravity of earth is ${gravity} m / s2.`
)
```

### Comparison Operators

In programming we compare values, we use a comparison operator to compare two values. We check if a value is greater or less or equal to another value.

![Comparison Operators](../images/comparison_operators.png)
**Example: Comparison Operators**

```js
console.log(3 > 2)              // true, because 3 is greater than 2
console.log(3 >= 2)             // true, because 3 is greater than 2
console.log(3 < 2)              // false,  because 3 is greater than 2
console.log(2 < 3)              // true, because 2 is less than 3
console.log(2 <= 3)             // true, because 2 is less than 3
console.log(3 == 2)             // false, because 3 is not equal to 2
console.log(3 != 2)             // true, because 3 is not equal to 2
console.log(3 == '3')           // true, compare only value
console.log(3 === '3')          // false, compare both value and data type
console.log(3 !== '3')          // true, compare both value and data type
console.log(3 != 3)             // false, compare only value
console.log(3 !== 3)            // false, compare both value and data type
console.log(0 == false)         // true, equivalent
console.log(0 === false)        // false, not exactly the same
console.log(0 == '')            // true, equivalent
console.log(0 == ' ')           // true, equivalent
console.log(0 === '')           // false, not exactly the same
console.log(1 == true)          // true, equivalent
console.log(1 === true)         // false, not exactly the same
console.log(undefined == null)  // true
console.log(undefined === null) // false
console.log(NaN == NaN)         // false, not equal
console.log(NaN === NaN)        // false
console.log(typeof NaN)         // number

console.log('mango'.length == 'avocado'.length)  // false
console.log('mango'.length != 'avocado'.length)  // true
console.log('mango'.length < 'avocado'.length)   // true
console.log('milk'.length == 'meat'.length)      // true
console.log('milk'.length != 'meat'.length)      // false
console.log('tomato'.length == 'potato'.length)  // true
console.log('python'.length > 'dragon'.length)   // false
```

Try to understand the above comparisons with some logic. Remembering without any logic might be difficult.
JavaScript is somehow a wired kind of programming language. JavaScript code runs and gives you a result but unless you are good at it may not give the desired result.

As a rule of thumb, if a value is not considered true with == it won't be equal with ===. Using === is safer than using ==. The following [link](https://dorey.github.io/JavaScript-Equality-Table/) has an exhaustive list of comparisons of data types.

### Logical Operators

The following symbols are the common logical operators:
_&&_(ampersand) , ||(pipe) and !(negation).
The _&&_ operator evaluates to true only if the two operands are true.
The _||_ operator evaluates to true if either of the operand is true.
The _!_ operator converts true to false and false to true through negation.

```js
// && ampersand operator example

const check = 4 > 3 && 10 > 5         // true && true -> true
const check = 4 > 3 && 10 < 5         // true && false -> false
const check = 4 < 3 && 10 < 5         // false && false -> false

// || pipe or operator, example

const check = 4 > 3 || 10 > 5         // true  || true -> true
const check = 4 > 3 || 10 < 5         // true  || false -> true
const check = 4 < 3 || 10 < 5         // false || false -> false

//! Negation examples

let check = 4 > 3                     // true
let check = !(4 > 3)                  //  false
let isLightOn = true
let isLightOff = !isLightOn           // false
let isMarried = !false                // true
```

### Increment Operator

In JavaScript we use the increment operator to increase a value stored in a variable. The increment could be pre or post-increment. Let us see each of them:

1. Pre-increment

```js
let count = 0
console.log(++count)        // 1
console.log(count)          // 1
```

1. Post-increment

```js
let count = 0
console.log(count++)        // 0
console.log(count)          // 1
```

We use most of the time the post-increment. At least you should remember how to use the post-increment operator.

### Decrement Operator

In JavaScript we use the decrement operator to decrease a value stored in a variable. The decrement could be pre or post-decrement. Let us see each of them:

1. Pre-decrement

```js
let count = 0
console.log(--count) // -1
console.log(count)  // -1
```

2. Post-decrement

```js
let count = 0
console.log(count--) // 0
console.log(count)   // -1
```

### Ternary Operators

Ternary operator allows to write a condition.
Another way to write conditionals is using ternary operators. Look at the following examples:

```js
let isRaining = true
isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
isRaining = false

isRaining
  ? console.log('You need a rain coat.')
  : console.log('No need for a rain coat.')
```

```sh
You need a rain coat.
No need for a rain coat.
```

```js
let number = 5
number > 0
  ? console.log(`${number} is a positive number`)
  : console.log(`${number} is a negative number`)
number = -5

number > 0
  ? console.log(`${number} is a positive number`)
  : console.log(`${number} is a negative number`)
```

```sh
5 is a positive number
-5 is a negative number
```

### Operator Precedence

I recommend reading about operator precedence from this [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence)

## Window Methods

### Window alert() method

As you have seen, at very beginning the _alert()_ method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. It is a built-in method and it takes one argument.

```js
alert(message)
```

```js
alert('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript')
```

Do not use too much alerts because it is destructing and annoying, use it just to test.

### Window prompt() method

The window.prompt method displays an input prompt box in your browser, allowing you to gather input values that can be stored in variables. The _prompt()_ method requires two arguments, with the second one being optional.

```js
prompt('required text', 'optional text')
```

```js
let number = prompt('Enter number', 'number goes here')
console.log(number)
```

### Window confirm() method

The _confirm()_ method displays a dialog box with a specified message, along with an OK and a Cancel button.
A confirm box is often used to ask permission from a user to execute something. _Window.confirm()_ takes a string as argument.
Clicking the OK yields true value, whereas clicking the Cancel button yields false value.

```js
const agree = confirm('Are you sure you like to delete? ')
console.log(agree) // result will be true or false based on what you click on the dialog box
```

These are not all the window methods, we will have a separate section to go deep into window methods.

## Date Object

Time is an important thing. We like to know the time a certain activity or event. In JavaScript the current time and date are created using the JavaScript Date Object. The object created using the Date object offers numerous methods for handling dates and times. The methods employed to extract date and time details from date object values are prefixed with the word 'get' because they provide this information.
_getFullYear(), getMonth(), getDate(), getDay(), getHours(), getMinutes, getSeconds(), getMilliseconds(), getTime(), getDay()_

![Date time Object](../images/date_time_object.png)

### Creating a time object

Once we create a time object, the time object will provide information about time. Let us create a time object.

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now) // Sat Jan 04 2020 00:56:41 GMT+0200 (Eastern European Standard Time)
```

We have created a time object and we can access any date time information from an object using the get methods as we have mentioned.

### Getting full year

Let's extract or get the full year from a time object.

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getFullYear()) // 2020
```

### Getting month

Let's extract or get the month from a time object.

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getMonth()) // 0, because the month is January,  month(0-11)
```

### Getting date

Let's extract or get the date of the month from a time object.

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getDate()) // 4, because the day of the month is 4th,  day(1-31)
```

### Getting day

Let's extract or get the day of the week from a time object.

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getDay()) // 6, because the day is Saturday which is the 7th day
//  Sunday is 0, Monday is 1 and Saturday is 6
// Getting the weekday as a number (0-6)
```

### Getting hours

Let's extract or get the hours from a time object.

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getHours()) // 0, because the time is 00:56:41
```

### Getting minutes

Let's extract or get the minutes from a time object.

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getMinutes()) // 56, because the time is 00:56:41
```

### Getting seconds

Let's extract or get the seconds from a time object.

```js
const now = new Date()
console.log(now.getSeconds()) // 41, because the time is 00:56:41
```

### Getting time

This method gives the time in milliseconds starting from January 1, 1970. It is also known as Unix time. We can get the unix time in two ways:

1. Using _getTime()_

```js
const now = new Date() //
console.log(now.getTime()) // 1578092201341, this is the number of seconds passed from January 1, 1970 to January 4, 2020 00:56:41
```

1. Using _Date.now()_

```js
const allSeconds = Date.now() //
console.log(allSeconds) // 1578092201341, this is the number of seconds passed from January 1, 1970 to January 4, 2020 00:56:41

const timeInSeconds = new Date().getTime()
console.log(allSeconds == timeInSeconds) // true
```

Let us format these values to a human readable time format.
**Example:**

```js
const now = new Date()
const year = now.getFullYear() // return year
const month = now.getMonth() + 1 // return month(0 - 11)
const date = now.getDate() // return date (1 - 31)
const hours = now.getHours() // return number (0 - 23)
const minutes = now.getMinutes() // return number (0 -59)

console.log(`${date}/${month}/${year} ${hours}:${minutes}`) // 4/1/2020 0:56
```
