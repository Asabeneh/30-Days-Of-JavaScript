### Exercises: Level 2

1. Write a script that prompt the user to enter base and height of the triangle and calculate an area of a triangle (area = 0.5 x b x h).

   ```sh
   Enter base: 20
   Enter height: 10
   The area of the triangle is 50
   ```

1. Write a script that prompt the user to enter side a, side b, and side c of the triangle and and calculate the perimeter of triangle (perimeter = a + b + c)

   ```sh
   Enter side a: 5
   Enter side b: 4
   Enter side c: 3
   The perimeter of the triangle is 12
   ```

1. Get length and width using prompt and calculate an area of rectangle (area = length x width and the perimeter of rectangle (perimeter = 2 x (length + width))
1. Get radius using prompt and calculate the area of a circle (area = pi x r x r) and circumference of a circle(c = 2 x pi x r) where pi = 3.14.
1. Calculate the slope, x-intercept and y-intercept of y = 2x -2
1. Slope is (m = y2-y1/x2-x1). Find the slope between point (2, 2) and point(6,10)
1. Compare the slope of above two questions.
1. Calculate the value of y (y = x^2 + 6x + 9). Try to use different x values and figure out at what x value y is 0.
1. Writ a script that prompt a user to enter hours and rate per hour. Calculate pay of the person?

    ```sh
    Enter hours: 40
    Enter rate per hour: 28
    Your weekly earning is 1120
    ```

1. If the length of your name is greater than 7 say, your name is long else say your name is short.
1. Compare your first name length and your family name length and you should get this output.

    ```js
    let firstName = 'Asabeneh'
    let lastName = 'Yetayeh'
    ```

    ```sh
    Your first name, Asabeneh is longer than your family name, Yetayeh
    ```

1. Declare two variables _myAge_ and _yourAge_ and assign them initial values and myAge and yourAge.

   ```js
   let myAge = 250
   let yourAge = 25
   ```

   ```sh
   I am 225 years older than you.
   ```

1. Using prompt get the year the user was born and if the user is 18 or above allow the user to drive if not tell the user to wait a certain amount of years.

    ```sh

    Enter birth year: 1995
    You are 25. You are old enough to drive

    Enter birth year: 2005
    You are 15. You will be allowed to drive after 3 years.
    ```

1. Write a script that prompt the user to enter number of years. Calculate the number of seconds a person can live. Assume some one lives just hundred years

   ```sh
   Enter number of yours you live: 100
   You lived 3153600000 seconds.
   ```

1. Create a human readable time format using the Date time object
   1. YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm
   2. DD-MM-YYYY HH:mm
   3. DD/MM/YYYY HH:mm

### Exercises: Level 3

1. Create a human readable time format using the Date time object. The hour and the minute should be all the time two digits(7 hours should be 07 and 5 minutes should be 05 )
   1. YYY-MM-DD HH:mm eg. 20120-01-02 07:05
